BuildCamp
=========

Welcome to BuildCamp! You're about to learn everything you need to know to build the next great startup. You'll learn frontend development of modern websites, backend server concepts, all about databases, and how to build a mobile app for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.

## What to expect ##
We'll be meeting all week. The first four days each contain 6 sessions of 50 minutes each, 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon. We'll have an hour break for lunch each day. Also, the last hour of the day will be an open hacking session where you can get all of your questions answered. The final day of the week is devoted to hacking on your project. You'll present it at the end of the day at the closing reception.

Don't stop there though. Take what you've learned and continue building your project throughout the rest of the summer. Keep in touch. We're here to help!

## Prerequisites ##
It's assumed that you know one programming language already. Many of you will have taken AP Computer Science and know Java. You'll be in great shape.

You should spend some time learning JavaScript before arriving. A great resources is the free online book [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). There's also great JavaScript tutorials on [Codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/). You should know JavaScript's fundamental data types, how to make a function, how to make decisions with `if`, and how to make loops with `for`. You should also know a bit about HTML and CSS.

## What to do now ##
Your first task in BuildCamp is to clone this repository. This gives you a local copy of it on your own computer so you can follow along. It also gives you the code samples.
